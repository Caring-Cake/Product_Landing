# Product_Landing
FreeCodeCamp project uploaded to GitHub

This isn't a real product, this was created by me with the purpose of practicing my web-development, as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.
I was allowed to choose the product, so I chose the Kitchen Gun.

The Kitchen Gun was a joke featured on the Peter Serafinowicz Show. I do not own the rights to Kitchen Gun.
The Kitchen Gun is property of the Peter Serafinowicz show.
